JQuery-based Game: 
The assignment was to create a Crystal Collector Game. I didn't like the crystals so much and so chose a more timely Bitcoin Collector (bitcoins currently valued at $7K). I also thought the layout of the assignment was awful. So I deliberately did not match it exactly. 

Years ago I was self-employed as a "computer consultant" and called my "company" Aardvark Computer Consulting. At that time, people still used the Yellow Pages, which were organized alphabetically. "Aardvark" gave me an advantage. At any rate, I may use that again. So I added a favicon of an aardvark. Made me happy!

The Bitcoin Collector game generates a random number that you must match by clicking on bitcoins. Each bitcoin has a randomly assigned value. Each value is added to your total. You need to match your total to the random number to win. You figure out the value of each bitcoin as your score changes. 

As long as your score remains below the random number, you keep playing. If you go above the random number, you lose. When you match the number, you WIN!

Good luck and have fun!

HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery were used to create this game.
